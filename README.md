# Mission-to-Mars
Module 10 - Web Scraping with HTML\CSS

# Overview of the Project
In this project we are helping Robin to build a website that not only scrapes the latest news for her, but will also serve to help her land her dream job at Nasa.

The tools used to accomplish this are:   Jupyter Notebook, Flask, Mongo, Bootstrap3 components, Beautiful Soup, Splinter and Python.

The process included:

- BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Marsâ€™s hemispheres and the titles of those images
- Store the scraped data on a Mongo database
- Utilizing a web application to display the data
- Alter the design of the web app to accommodate these images.

The Mongo database stores the scraped data.

The final product scrapes data from multiple sites and then consolidates the information into one site for the user.

The webpage was checked for mobile responsiveness and Bootstrap3 components were added.  The website is now responsive for all users, color scheme was updated and includes a hover option for the table.

This website will not only keep Robin up to date on the current Nasa news, but will help her to finally land her dream job!
